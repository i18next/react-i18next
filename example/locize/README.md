## using with locize

We added our translation management [locize.com](https://www.locize.com?utm_source=react_i18next_locize_readme&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=example_locize_readme).

InContext Editing:

- [locize](https://github.com/locize/locize)
- [locize-editor](https://github.com/locize/locize-editor) (old client)

i18next Backend: loading translations, save new segments during runtime

- [i18next-locize-backend](https://github.com/locize/i18next-locize-backend)

last used: sets a timestamp on every key touched -> safely remove old/unused keys

- [locize-lastused](https://github.com/locize/locize-lastused)

You will find your project informations like projectId and apiKey on your locize projects settings. (Signup add a new project for testing).

Set projectId and apiKey in `/src/i18n.js`.

## start

```bash
# npm start
```

insert `http://localhost:5173` in the locize client to open your application with the locize incontext editor.

### for old locize client:

open `http://localhost:5173?locize=true` to open your application with the locize incontext editor.

## build

```bash
# npm run build
```

creates the production build in `dist/` (`npm run preview` serves it locally).
