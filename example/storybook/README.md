This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## start app

```bash
# npm start
```

## start storybook

```bash
# npm run storybook
```

## information

In the sample we show both a component being decorated by translate hoc using a [storybook decorator](https://storybook.js.org/basics/writing-stories/#using-decorators) to wrap the `I18nextProvider` around the decorated component and a pure component just expecting a t function which we pass in with a mock function.
